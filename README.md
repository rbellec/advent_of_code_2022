# advent_of_code_2022

After tryin in Haskell, purescript or other languages/tools, I decided this year to focus on 
using a "no fighting with tooling" solution. I currently use rails on a daily basis, I know
I won't use rails features, but I feel that not having to think about "tooling, where to put 
daily codes, how can I use unit testing if I need to..." will just let me have more time for 
the fun parts.
